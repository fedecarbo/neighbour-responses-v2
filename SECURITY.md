# Security Considerations for Local Development

## Overview
This document outlines security practices and considerations for the UK Planning Neighbor Responses prototype application during local development.

## File Permissions

### Data Files
- `data/applications.json` should have read/write permissions for the development user only
- Ensure sensitive planning data is not accidentally committed to version control
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude any local data files containing real planning information

### Environment Files
- `.env.local` contains local development configuration
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables

## Local Development Security

### API Endpoints
- All API routes include error handling to prevent information leakage
- File operations are restricted to the designated `data/` directory
- Input validation is implemented for all comment update operations

### Data Handling
- Comment updates preserve audit trails (`originalContent`, `isEdited` flags)
- All file operations go through the centralized `fileOperations` utility
- In-memory caching includes TTL to prevent stale data issues

### Future Authentication Integration
- Middleware structure is prepared for NextAuth.js integration
- Authentication routes will be added in `/api/auth/` when moving beyond prototype
- Session management and CSRF protection will be implemented for production

## Testing Security
- Test data uses fictional addresses and planning applications
- No real personal data should be used in test scenarios
- E2E tests run against local development server only

## Production Considerations (Future)
When moving beyond prototype phase:
1. Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
3. Enable HTTPS for all communications
4. Implement proper logging and monitoring
5. Add input sanitization for all user inputs
6. Configure Content Security Policy headers
