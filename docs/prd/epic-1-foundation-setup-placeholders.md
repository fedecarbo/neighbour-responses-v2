# Epic 1: Foundation Setup & UI/UX Placeholders

**Epic Goal:** Establish complete project foundation with Next.js/TypeScript architecture and create UI/UX placeholders to sketch out the entire application structure, enabling rapid development of subsequent epics with all dependencies installed and architectural decisions made.

## Story 1.1: Complete Technical Foundation Setup

As a **developer**,
I want **Next.js 14+ project with all required dependencies and development tools**,
so that **all subsequent epics can focus on feature implementation without technical setup overhead**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project created with TypeScript configuration and proper folder structure (`/frontend`, `/backend`, `/shared`)
2. Shadcn UI component library integrated with default styling and themes
3. All mapping dependencies installed (Leaflet/Mapbox, React-Leaflet, required types)
4. State management solution configured (React Context or Redux Toolkit)
5. Database setup prepared (PostgreSQL connection, schema migrations ready)
6. Authentication framework installed and configured (NextAuth.js or similar)
7. API route structure established with proper TypeScript interfaces
8. Development environment fully configured (linting, formatting, testing, build processes)
9. Local development environment configured with proper security practices

## Story 1.2: Tab-Based Navigation Architecture

As a **planning officer**,
I want **complete tab-based navigation structure with placeholder content**,
so that **I can visualize the entire application workflow before features are implemented**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Tab-based routing implemented with Dashboard and Comments tab navigation
2. Basic layout component created using default Shadcn UI components
3. Dashboard tab placeholder showing analytics widgets, summary cards, and navigation structure
4. Comments tab placeholder with map area, comment list area, and filter controls
5. Navigation between tabs preserves application state and provides smooth transitions
6. Responsive layout ensuring proper mobile and desktop experience
7. All placeholder content clearly marked as "Coming in Epic X" with appropriate messaging

## Story 1.3: UI Component Library & Design System

As a **developer**,
I want **a complete set of reusable UI components with consistent styling**,
so that **all subsequent feature development uses standardized, accessible components**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Default Shadcn UI components installed and configured with standard accessibility features
2. Map placeholder component created with basic container styling using default Tailwind classes
3. Comment card component template using default Shadcn UI card components
4. Filter component templates using default Shadcn UI form components (dropdowns, checkboxes, inputs)
5. Dashboard widget templates using default Shadcn UI card and typography components
6. Navigation components using default Shadcn UI navigation patterns with standard ARIA support
7. Loading states and error handling components using default Shadcn UI patterns

## Story 1.4: Data Architecture & API Foundation

As a **developer**,
I want **complete data architecture with API endpoints and TypeScript interfaces**,
so that **frontend and backend integration is seamless from Epic 2 onwards**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL database schema designed for planning applications, comments, and user management
2. Database migration scripts created for development and production deployment
3. API route structure established for all required endpoints (CRUD operations, filtering, authentication)
4. TypeScript interfaces defined in `/shared` directory for all data models and API responses
5. Authentication middleware implemented for secure officer access
6. API documentation generated with example requests and responses
7. Error handling patterns established for consistent API responses
8. Database connection pooling and environment configuration completed
