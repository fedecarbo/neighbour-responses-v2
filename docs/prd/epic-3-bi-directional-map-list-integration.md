# Epic 3: Bi-Directional Map-List Integration

**Epic Goal:** Implement synchronized filtering between map pin selections and comment lists, enabling core spatial-first navigation workflow that allows planning officers to seamlessly transition between spatial context and detailed comment investigation.

## Story 3.1: Map Pin Selection Filters Comment List

As a **planning officer**,
I want **comment list updates when I select map pins**,
so that **I can focus on neighbor responses from specific geographic areas**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Map pin selection triggers comment list filtering to show only comments from selected pin locations
2. Filter operation completes in under 500ms maintaining workflow continuity
3. Filtered comment list displays count indicator (e.g., "Showing 5 of 23 comments")
4. Multiple pin selections supported with comment list showing combined results from all selected areas
5. Filter state clearly communicated through UI indicators and selected pin highlighting
6. No-selection state displays all comments with clear indication that no filters are applied

## Story 3.2: Comment List Selection Highlights Map Pins

As a **planning officer**,
I want **map pins highlighted when I select comments from the list**,
so that **I maintain spatial context while reviewing detailed neighbor responses**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Comment list item selection highlights corresponding map pin with distinct visual emphasis
2. Selected comment-to-pin mapping accurately reflects geographic coordinate relationships
3. Bi-directional synchronization maintains both comment selection and pin highlighting simultaneously
4. Multiple comment selections from same geographic area maintain single pin highlight
5. Comment deselection removes pin highlighting with smooth visual transition
6. Spatial context preserved during comment list scrolling and interaction

## Story 3.3: Centralized Filter State Management

As a **planning officer**,
I want **consistent filter behavior across map and list interactions**,
so that **I have a single source of truth for my current investigation focus**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Centralized state management implemented for all filtering operations using React context or state management
2. Filter state persists across tab navigation (Dashboard to Comments) maintaining investigation context
3. Filter clear functionality resets both map pin selections and comment list to show all data
4. Filter state visible through URL parameters enabling bookmark/share capability for specific filtered views
5. Error handling implemented for filter operations with user feedback for any synchronization failures
6. Filter state debugging capabilities available for development and user support
