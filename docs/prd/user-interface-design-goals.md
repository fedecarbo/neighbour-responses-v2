# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a spatial-investigation workflow that transforms planning officers from reactive comment processors into proactive spatial analysts. The interface prioritizes immediate visual context through interactive mapping, with clean tab-based architecture preventing cognitive overload while maintaining seamless transitions between analytical overview and detailed comment management.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Spatial-First Navigation**: Interactive map serves as primary navigation paradigm with clickable pins driving workflow progression
- **Bi-Directional Synchronization**: Map selections filter comment lists; comment selections highlight map locations, maintaining continuous spatial context
- **Cross-Tab Drill-Down**: Dashboard statistics serve as entry points that automatically apply relevant filters when navigating to Comments tab
- **Visual State Feedback**: Real-time highlighting of filter states through map pin emphasis and synchronized interface elements

## Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the critical screens necessary to deliver PRD value:
- **Dashboard Analytics Screen**: Statistics overview with clickable drill-down navigation
- **Interactive Map View**: Color-coded pin visualization with selection capabilities
- **Filtered Comment List**: Synchronized comment display with individual comment details
- **Individual Comment Detail**: Basic editing and publication decision interface

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard accessibility compliance for UK local authority web applications, ensuring planning officers with diverse abilities can effectively use spatial-first workflows.

## Branding
Clean, professional interface appropriate for UK local government planning departments. Emphasize clarity and efficiency over visual flourishes, with color-coding limited to essential sentiment visualization (red/yellow/green pins) that supports decision-making rather than decoration.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-focused web application optimized for Windows 10/11 and macOS 10.15+ environments with modern browser support, reflecting typical planning department IT infrastructure and officer workflow patterns.
