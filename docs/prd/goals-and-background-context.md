# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

• **Transform officer workflows** from manual comment processors to strategic decision-makers through spatial-first navigation
• **Reduce comment processing time** by 40% within 6 months through interactive mapping and intelligent filtering
• **Improve spatial understanding** with 90% of officers reporting enhanced context of neighbor concerns within first month
• **Establish technical foundation** supporting 100+ concurrent applications with sub-2 second map interaction response
• **Validate spatial-first approach** through 5+ pilot users demonstrating preference over current linear workflows
• **Create seamless workflow integration** between analytics overview and detailed comment management

## Background Context

UK planning officers currently struggle with inefficient neighbor response processing workflows that lack spatial context and streamlined comment management tools. Officers spend 60-70% of their time on administrative comment processing rather than strategic decision-making, manually reviewing text-heavy lists without immediate visual understanding of geographic relationships or sentiment patterns. This results in cognitive overload, delayed decisions, and missed spatial patterns in neighbor concerns.

Our solution addresses this through a dual-tab web application positioning interactive spatial mapping as the primary navigation paradigm. The Dashboard tab provides analytics-first overview with immediate sentiment visualization, while the Comments tab features interactive maps with color-coded pins synchronized to filterable comment lists. This spatial-first architecture transforms planning application review from linear text-processing into spatial investigation workflows, enabling officers to quickly identify concern areas and efficiently manage publication decisions through visual, context-aware interfaces.
