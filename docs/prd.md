# UK Planning Officer Neighbor Response Web App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

• **Transform officer workflows** from manual comment processors to strategic decision-makers through spatial-first navigation
• **Reduce comment processing time** by 40% within 6 months through interactive mapping and intelligent filtering
• **Improve spatial understanding** with 90% of officers reporting enhanced context of neighbor concerns within first month
• **Establish technical foundation** supporting 100+ concurrent applications with sub-2 second map interaction response
• **Validate spatial-first approach** through 5+ pilot users demonstrating preference over current linear workflows
• **Create seamless workflow integration** between analytics overview and detailed comment management

### Background Context

UK planning officers currently struggle with inefficient neighbor response processing workflows that lack spatial context and streamlined comment management tools. Officers spend 60-70% of their time on administrative comment processing rather than strategic decision-making, manually reviewing text-heavy lists without immediate visual understanding of geographic relationships or sentiment patterns. This results in cognitive overload, delayed decisions, and missed spatial patterns in neighbor concerns.

Our solution addresses this through a dual-tab web application positioning interactive spatial mapping as the primary navigation paradigm. The Dashboard tab provides analytics-first overview with immediate sentiment visualization, while the Comments tab features interactive maps with color-coded pins synchronized to filterable comment lists. This spatial-first architecture transforms planning application review from linear text-processing into spatial investigation workflows, enabling officers to quickly identify concern areas and efficiently manage publication decisions through visual, context-aware interfaces.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a spatial-investigation workflow that transforms planning officers from reactive comment processors into proactive spatial analysts. The interface prioritizes immediate visual context through interactive mapping, with clean tab-based architecture preventing cognitive overload while maintaining seamless transitions between analytical overview and detailed comment management.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Spatial-First Navigation**: Interactive map serves as primary navigation paradigm with clickable pins driving workflow progression
- **Bi-Directional Synchronization**: Map selections filter comment lists; comment selections highlight map locations, maintaining continuous spatial context
- **Cross-Tab Drill-Down**: Dashboard statistics serve as entry points that automatically apply relevant filters when navigating to Comments tab
- **Visual State Feedback**: Real-time highlighting of filter states through map pin emphasis and synchronized interface elements

### Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the critical screens necessary to deliver PRD value:
- **Dashboard Analytics Screen**: Statistics overview with clickable drill-down navigation
- **Interactive Map View**: Color-coded pin visualization with selection capabilities
- **Filtered Comment List**: Synchronized comment display with individual comment details
- **Individual Comment Detail**: Basic editing and publication decision interface

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard accessibility compliance for UK local authority web applications, ensuring planning officers with diverse abilities can effectively use spatial-first workflows.

### Branding
Clean, professional interface appropriate for UK local government planning departments. Emphasize clarity and efficiency over visual flourishes, with color-coding limited to essential sentiment visualization (red/yellow/green pins) that supports decision-making rather than decoration.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-focused web application optimized for Windows 10/11 and macOS 10.15+ environments with modern browser support, reflecting typical planning department IT infrastructure and officer workflow patterns.
