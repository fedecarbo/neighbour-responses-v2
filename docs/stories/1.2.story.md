# Story 1.2: Tab-Based Navigation Architecture

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** planning officer,
**I want** complete tab-based navigation structure with placeholder content,
**so that** I can visualize the entire application workflow before features are implemented.

## User Context & Journey

### Primary User Goals
- **Immediate Goal**: Navigate between different views of planning application data efficiently
- **Task Flow**: Dashboard overview → Detailed comment analysis → Back to summary when needed
- **Mental Model**: Tabs represent complementary views of the same application, not separate workflows
- **Success Criteria**: User can switch between views without losing context or having to re-enter information

### Expected User Journey
1. **Entry Point**: User arrives from application list with specific application selected
2. **Default Landing**: Dashboard tab provides immediate overview and key metrics
3. **Deep Dive**: Comments tab offers detailed analysis and community feedback
4. **Context Switching**: Frequent back-and-forth between tabs during review process
5. **Exit Strategy**: Clear path back to application list or next application

### User Pain Points to Address
- **Context Loss**: Losing filters or selections when switching tabs
- **Cognitive Load**: Unclear relationship between Dashboard and Comments data
- **Orientation**: Getting lost in navigation without clear location indicators

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Navigation (Critical UX Requirements)
1. **Tab Navigation Experience**: Tab-based routing with clear active/inactive states, smooth transitions, and preserved scroll position
2. **Layout Foundation**: Basic layout component using default Shadcn UI with consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
3. **State Continuity**: Navigation between tabs preserves all filter states, selections, and user context without data loss

### Dashboard Tab UX Requirements
4. **Dashboard Preview**: Analytics widgets and summary cards with user-benefit descriptions (not "Coming Soon" messaging)
   - Example: "Application Timeline: Track progress from submission to approval"
   - Visual hierarchy showing most important metrics first
   - Clear call-to-action areas for future interactions

### Comments Tab UX Requirements  
5. **Comments Layout Preview**: Map area, comment list, and filter controls with functional relationship indicators
   - Map and list areas show visual connection (synchronized selection states)
   - Filter controls demonstrate their effect scope
   - Clear content organization with scannable layout

### Responsive & Accessibility
6. **Multi-Device Experience**: Mobile-first responsive design with touch-friendly interactions and readable content at all breakpoints
7. **Universal Access**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements

### User Expectations Management
8. **Progressive Enhancement**: Placeholder content uses benefit-focused messaging that educates users about upcoming functionality
   - Replace "Coming in Epic X" with "This feature will help you..."
   - Include realistic data previews where possible
   - Visual indicators show interactive vs. informational areas

## UX Design Specifications

### Interaction Design Requirements

#### Tab Navigation Behavior
**Visual States**:
- **Active Tab**: Distinct visual indicator (underline, background, or border using default Shadcn UI styling)
- **Inactive Tab**: Clear but subdued appearance with hover state feedback
- **Hover State**: Subtle visual feedback indicating clickability
- **Focus State**: Clear keyboard focus indicator for accessibility
- **Loading State**: Visual feedback during tab content loading (skeleton or spinner)

**Interaction Patterns**:
- **Click/Tap**: Immediate tab switch with smooth transition animation
- **Keyboard**: Arrow key navigation between tabs, Enter/Space to select
- **Touch**: Touch-friendly target sizes (minimum 44px) on mobile devices
- **Transition Timing**: 200-300ms smooth transition between tab content

#### Content Layout Hierarchy
**Dashboard Tab Structure**:
1. **Primary Metrics** (Top): Most critical KPIs in large, scannable format
2. **Secondary Analytics** (Middle): Supporting charts and trend data
3. **Action Items** (Bottom): Next steps and recommended actions

**Comments Tab Structure**:
1. **Filter Bar** (Top): Search and filter controls with clear labels
2. **Split View** (Main): Map (left/top) and comment list (right/bottom)
3. **Synchronization Indicators**: Visual cues showing map-list connections

#### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- **Tab Load Failure**: Error message with retry option
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging explaining why content isn't available
- **Slow Loading**: Progressive loading with skeleton placeholders
- **Network Issues**: Offline indicators with graceful degradation

### Accessibility Specifications

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Order**: Logical sequence through all interactive elements
- **Focus Management**: Focus moves to tab content after selection
- **Escape Patterns**: Clear exit strategies from any focus trap
- **Shortcuts**: Consider Alt+1 (Dashboard), Alt+2 (Comments) shortcuts

#### Screen Reader Support  
- **Tab Labels**: Descriptive labels including current selection state
- **Content Updates**: Announce tab changes and loading states
- **Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy within each tab
- **Context**: Clear indication of current location and available actions

#### Visual Accessibility
- **Color Independence**: Information conveyed through multiple visual cues (not color alone)
- **Contrast Ratios**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Text Scaling**: Readable and functional up to 200% zoom
- **Motion**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Responsive Design Breakpoints

#### Mobile (320px - 768px)
- **Tab Style**: Full-width stacked tabs or horizontal scrollable tabs
- **Content**: Single-column layout with prioritized information
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px tap targets with adequate spacing
- **Navigation**: Bottom or top tab bar for easy thumb access

#### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- **Tab Style**: Horizontal tab bar with icon + label
- **Content**: Two-column layout where appropriate
- **Interactions**: Support both touch and potential keyboard/mouse

#### Desktop (1024px+)
- **Tab Style**: Full horizontal tab bar with hover states
- **Content**: Multi-column layouts with maximum information density
- **Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts and advanced interactions
