# Story 2.2: Interactive Map Component with Color-Coded Pins

## Status
Done
## Story

**As a** planning officer,
**I want** an interactive map displaying color-coded neighbor sentiment pins,
**so that** I can immediately visualize geographic patterns in neighbor responses.

## User Context & Journey

### Primary Officer Goals
- **Immediate Goal**: Access interactive spatial visualization of neighbor sentiment patterns with color-coded pins
- **Task Flow**: Map loading → Geographic context establishment → Pin identification → Visual pattern recognition → Spatial filtering initiation
- **Mental Model**: Color-coded map pins provide instant geographic sentiment overview enabling spatial analysis and targeted investigation
- **Success Criteria**: Officers can rapidly identify sentiment patterns across geographic areas with intuitive visual feedback

### Expected Officer Journey
1. **Map Loading**: Access Comments tab and see UK-focused interactive map with proper geographic context
2. **Pin Recognition**: Immediately identify neighbor locations with color-coded sentiment indicators (red/yellow/green)
3. **Visual Pattern Analysis**: Assess geographic clustering of sentiment types and spatial distribution patterns
4. **Interactive Exploration**: Pan and zoom smoothly while maintaining pin visibility and performance
5. **Selection Initiation**: Click pins to begin spatial filtering for detailed comment investigation

### Officer Pain Points to Address
- **Geographic Context Loss**: Need UK-appropriate map tiles and zoom levels for planning context
- **Application Location Confusion**: Need immediate visual identification of the actual planning application site versus neighbor locations
- **Spatial Relationship Unclear**: Difficult to assess proximity and impact relationships without clear application focus
- **Sentiment Identification**: Require immediate visual sentiment recognition without clicking or hovering
- **Performance Issues**: Need sub-2 second map loading with smooth interactions for professional efficiency
- **Selection Feedback**: Need clear visual indication of pin interaction and selection state preparation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Leaflet Integration**: Leaflet or Mapbox map component integrated into Comments tab with application-centered view
2. **Application Pin**: Distinct application marker at planning site (15 Oxford Road) with unique styling (house icon, larger size, highest z-index)
3. **Map Centering**: Map automatically centers on application coordinates (53.4722, -2.2374) with zoom level 18 for immediate vicinity context
4. **Color-Coded Neighbor Pins**: Neighbor comment pins rendered with color-coding: red (negative), yellow (neutral), green (positive sentiment)
5. **Development Boundaries**: Visual indication of proposed development footprint if boundary data available in future iterations
6. **Performance Standards**: Map loads in under 2 seconds with smooth pan/zoom interactions
7. **Pin Click Events**: Pin click events capture and log selected neighbor location for filtering integration
8. **UK Geographic Context**: Map displays proper UK geographic context with appropriate tile layers
9. **Professional Styling**: Visual pin styling clearly distinguishable and professional for planning department use

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion:
- Single mock application with 28 comments successfully implemented in `apps/web/src/data/mock-application.json`
- TypeScript interfaces established in `packages/shared/src/types/` for planning, comments, spatial, and filters
- API routes functional: GET `/api/application`, GET `/api/application/comments`
- Manchester coordinates proven functional (53.4722, -2.2374 area) with 28 neighbor comments
- Geographic coordinates validated within Manchester bounds (53.4705-53.4755 lat, -2.2392 to -2.2340 lng)
- Balanced sentiment distribution: 10 positive, 9 negative, 9 neutral comments ready for pin color-coding

### Technology Stack Implementation
**Mapping Library Selection** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- **Primary**: Leaflet 1.9+ for lightweight, flexible spatial interactions vs Mapbox complexity
- **Tiles**: OpenStreetMap tiles (no API keys required, suitable for government prototype)
- **Wrapper**: React-Leaflet for React integration with TypeScript support
- **Performance**: Next.js dynamic imports required for handling Leaflet's window dependency

### Data Models and Interfaces  
**Comment Pin Data Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#neighborcomment]:

```typescript
interface NeighborComment {
  id: string;
  applicationId: string;
  neighborAddress: string;
  coordinates: GeographicCoordinate; // For pin positioning
  content: string;
  sentiment: SentimentType; // For color coding: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative'

  longitude: number; // UK range: ~-8.2 to 1.8
  precision?: number;
  source?: string;
}

type SentimentType = 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
```

### Component Architecture Implementation
**Map Component Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:

```typescript
// Component location: apps/web/src/components/map/MapComponent.tsx
interface MapComponentProps {
  comments: NeighborComment[];
  onPinClick: (commentId: string) => void;
  selectedPins: string[];
}

// Pin component: apps/web/src/components/map/CommentPin.tsx  
interface CommentPinProps {
  comment: NeighborComment;

```

### API Integration Requirements
**Data Loading** [Source: architecture/components.md#apiservice]:
- Use existing GET `/api/application` endpoint to load application with comments
- Comments already include coordinates: `{ latitude: number, longitude: number }`
- No new API endpoints needed - reuse existing data structures
- Manchester area coordinates already validated and functional

### UI Standards and Styling
**Component Styling Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- **UI Components**: Only use default Shadcn UI components without any customizations to appearance or styling
- **Theme Consistency**: Use only default Tailwind CSS theme without custom color palettes, spacing, or typography modifications
- **Pin Performance**: Pin components must be memoized and use stable keys to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Visual Design Requirements** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#ui-styling-standards]:
- Use default Shadcn UI components without customizations
- Apply default Tailwind CSS theme without custom modifications
- Maintain consistent default styling across all components

### Performance Requirements
**Map Loading Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Map performance: Pin components must be memoized and use stable keys to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Sub-2 second loading requirement for map initialization
- Smooth pan/zoom interactions without lag
- Efficient rendering of 28 pins simultaneously

### Geographic Context Requirements
**UK Map Configuration**:
- **Application-Centered View**: Map centers exactly on planning application at 15 Oxford Road (53.4722, -2.2374)
- **Immediate Vicinity Zoom**: Zoom level 18 to show immediate neighborhood context and spatial relationships
- **Application Pin Prominence**: Distinct house icon marker with highest z-index, larger than neighbor pins
- **OpenStreetMap tiles**: For UK geographic context without API key requirements
- **Coordinate validation**: Within Manchester bounds (53.47-53.48 lat, -2.24 to -2.23 lng for Oxford Road area)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Use Vitest for component unit testing with React Testing Library
- Use Playwright for E2E testing of map interactions
- Follow existing test organization patterns in `apps/web/tests/`

**Component Testing Requirements**:
- Test CommentPin component renders with correct sentiment colors
- Test map loading and pin positioning with mock coordinate data
- Test click event handling and console logging functionality
- Validate geographic bounds and coordinate validation

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]:
```
apps/web/tests/
├── components/map/
│   ├── MapComponent.test.tsx     # NEW: Map container tests
│   └── CommentPin.test.tsx       # NEW: Pin component tests
└── integration/
    └── map-loading.test.tsx      # NEW: Map integration tests
```

**Test Examples** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]:
```typescript
// CommentPin sentiment color testing
describe('CommentPin', () => {
  it('renders with correct sentiment color', () => {
    const mockComment = {
      id: 'test-comment',
      sentiment: 'negative',
      coordinates: { latitude: 53.4722, longitude: -2.2374 }
    };

    const { container } = render(
      <CommentPin 
        comment={mockComment}
        isSelected={false}
        onPinClick={jest.fn()}
        onPinHover={jest.fn()}
      />
    );
    
    const pin = container.querySelector('.comment-pin');
    expect(pin).toHaveStyle('backgroundColor: #ef4444'); // red for negative
  });
});
```

**Performance Testing Requirements**:
- Map loads in under 2 seconds with 28 pins + 1 application pin
- Application pin always renders with highest priority and prominence
- Pin rendering performance with stable keys and memoization
- Smooth pan/zoom interactions without lag
- Click event responsiveness validation for both neighbor and application pins

**Development Boundaries Future Enhancement**:
For subsequent story iterations, if development boundary data becomes available in the mock application JSON (e.g., `boundaryCoordinates`, `proposedFootprint`), the map should display:
- **Proposed Extension Outline**: Red boundary showing development footprint
- **Existing Building Boundary**: Blue outline of current structure
- **Property Boundary**: Dashed line showing full site boundary
- **Impact Zones**: Visual indicators for privacy/overshadowing analysis

This would provide immediate spatial context for officers to assess neighbor concerns about overshadowing, privacy, and scale.
