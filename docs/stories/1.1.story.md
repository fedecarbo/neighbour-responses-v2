- React Context + useReducer for state management
- Leaflet 1.9+ for mapping
- Vitest for testing (Frontend and Backend)

**Critical UI Rules** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#ui-styling-standards]:
- Use only default Shadcn UI components without any customizations to appearance or styling
- Apply only default Tailwind CSS theme without custom color palettes, spacing, or typography modifications
- No custom adjustments to component look and feel

**Critical Fullstack Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- All geographic coordinates must use shared TypeScript interfaces from packages/shared
- Never access JSON files directly - always use the fileOperations utility layer
- All filter state changes must go through centralized FilterContext
- Every major component must have error boundary wrapping
- Comment updates must preserve originalContent and set isEdited flags for audit compliance

- **Frontend Unit Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library
  - Location: `apps/web/tests/components/`
  - Test all UI components with proper mocking

  - Location: `apps/web/tests/api/`
  - Test all file operations and error handling
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright
  - Location: `apps/web/tests/e2e/`
  - Test complete workflows and user interactions

**Test Organization Structure** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality** with professional-grade architecture and adherence to specifications. The monorepo structure is correctly implemented with proper workspace dependencies, TypeScript configuration, and shared types management. The file operations utility layer provides robust caching and error handling while maintaining the required abstraction over JSON data access. State management follows React best practices with Context + useReducer pattern for centralized filter synchronization.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/applications/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed unused NextRequest import and parameter
  - **Why**: Eliminated ESLint warnings and cleaned up unused code
  - **How**: Improved code maintainability by removing unnecessary dependencies

- **File**: `apps/web/src/utils/errorHandling.ts`
  - **Change**: Properly handled field parameter in ValidationError constructor
  - **Why**: Eliminated ESLint warnings while preserving future extensibility
  - **How**: Added conditional usage pattern with documentation for future field-specific error handling

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All critical fullstack rules followed, proper naming conventions, audit compliance implemented

- [x] Verified all tests pass (7/7 tests passing)
- [x] Confirmed clean linting with no errors or warnings
- [x] Validated TypeScript compilation without errors
- [x] Verified audit compliance in comment update functionality
- [x] Confirmed proper error handling patterns throughout codebase

### Security Review

**Security practices properly implemented:**
- Environment variables structure with .env.example template
- Proper file permissions documented in SECURITY.md
- No secrets or sensitive data exposed in codebase
- Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- Input validation patterns prepared in ValidationError class

### Performance Considerations

**Performance optimizations implemented:**
- In-memory caching for JSON data with 5-minute TTL
- Proper memoization patterns documented for future Map components
- Efficient file operations with minimal I/O overhead
- Clean separation of concerns reducing unnecessary re-renders

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This implementation demonstrates senior-level code quality with excellent architecture, comprehensive testing, proper error handling, and full compliance with all technical requirements. The foundation is robust and well-prepared for subsequent feature development.
