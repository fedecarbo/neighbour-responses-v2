## Technique Sessions

### User Journey Mapping - (In Progress)

**Description:** Mapping the planning officer's workflow from landing on application through comment management

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Single landing page with comprehensive application overview
2. Interactive map as primary navigation tool
3. Integrated sentiment visualization through color-coded pins
4. Seamless transition from map to detailed statistics
5. Individual neighbor comment editing workflow
6. Dynamic map-to-list filtering - pin selection filters comment list
7. Synchronized interface elements for unified navigation
8. Multi-selection with Ctrl+click for comparative analysis
9. Clear visual feedback for selected/active map pins
10. Bi-directional map-list interaction (click list → highlight pin)
11. Context-aware statistics that update with selections
12. Visual breadcrumb showing current filter state
13. Two-tab interface: "Dashboard" for statistics, "Comments" for map+list
14. Tab-based workflow separation for focused tasks
15. Quick navigation between map and detailed comment editing
16. Dashboard as dedicated analytics workspace
17. Filter controls centralized in Comments tab neighbor list
18. Clickable Dashboard statistics for drill-down navigation
19. Cross-tab filter passing - Dashboard stats → Comments with pre-applied filters
20. Map visualization updates based on list filters automatically

**Insights Discovered:**
- Officers need immediate visual context (map first approach)
- Comment management requires both bulk and individual editing capabilities
- Publication workflow needs clear status indicators
- Prototype should demonstrate real-world officer decision points
- Dashboard-to-Comments drill-down creates seamless investigation workflow
- Centralized filtering prevents UI complexity and maintains single source of truth

**Notable Connections:**
- Map interaction drives deeper investigation into specific neighbors
- Statistics overview informs publication decisions
- Individual comment pages serve as detailed working space
- Overview-first hierarchy provides immediate decision context
- Vertical scroll flow matches natural reading patterns

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Two-Tab Interface Architecture**
   - Description: Dashboard tab for analytics + Comments tab for map/list interaction
   - Why immediate: Simple routing implementation, clear separation of concerns
   - Resources needed: Next.js routing, Shadcn Tabs component

2. **Interactive Map with Pin Selection**
   - Description: Color-coded pins (red/yellow/green) with click-to-filter functionality
   - Why immediate: Core feature using standard mapping libraries (Leaflet/Mapbox)
   - Resources needed: Map integration, pin styling, click handlers

3. **Comment List with Filter Integration**
   - Description: Synchronized comment list that updates based on map pin selections
   - Why immediate: Standard React state management and list filtering
   - Resources needed: useState/useContext for filter state, array filtering logic

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **Advanced Multi-Select Filter System**
   - Description: Complex AND/OR logic filters with persistent state and cross-tab navigation
   - Development needed: State management architecture, URL parameter sync, filter logic optimization
   - Timeline estimate: 2-3 weeks after MVP

2. **Real-time Sentiment Analysis Integration**
   - Description: Automated comment sentiment scoring with manual override capabilities
   - Development needed: NLP service integration or local sentiment analysis model
   - Timeline estimate: 4-6 weeks, separate development track

3. **Dashboard Drill-down Analytics**
   - Description: Clickable statistics that navigate to filtered comment views
   - Development needed: Analytics component architecture, cross-tab parameter passing
   - Timeline estimate: 2-3 weeks after core features

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts*

1. **AI-Powered Comment Categorization**
   - Description: Automatic tagging of comments with topics (traffic, noise, design) using AI
   - Transformative potential: Eliminates manual tagging workload for planning officers
   - Challenges to overcome: Training data collection, accuracy validation, officer trust in AI decisions

2. **Predictive Neighbor Response Modeling**
   - Description: ML model predicting which neighbors likely to respond/object based on historical data
   - Transformative potential: Proactive community engagement and risk assessment
   - Challenges to overcome: Historical data access, privacy considerations, model accuracy

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Spatial-first design**: Map interaction as primary navigation creates intuitive officer workflow
- **Centralized filtering**: Single source of truth for filters prevents UI complexity and maintains consistency
- **Tab-based workflows**: Separating analytics from detailed work prevents cognitive overload
- **Drill-down navigation**: Dashboard-to-Comments flow enables seamless investigation from insight to action
- **Bi-directional sync**: Map-list interaction needs to work both ways for comprehensive spatial understanding

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Core Tab Structure with Map Integration
- **Rationale**: Foundation for all other features - establishes architecture and core user workflow
- **Next steps**: Set up Next.js project, implement tab routing, integrate map component with mock data
- **Resources needed**: Next.js 14+, Shadcn UI, Leaflet/Mapbox, TypeScript
- **Timeline**: Week 1-2

#### #2 Priority: Pin Selection and Comment Filtering
- **Rationale**: Core interactive functionality that demonstrates the app's primary value proposition
- **Next steps**: Implement pin click handlers, comment list filtering logic, state management
- **Resources needed**: React state management, mock neighbor/comment data structure
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3

#### #3 Priority: Dashboard Statistics with Clickable Navigation
- **Rationale**: Completes the officer workflow loop from insights to detailed investigation
- **Next steps**: Create statistics components, implement cross-tab navigation with filter passing
- **Resources needed**: Chart library (Chart.js/Recharts), URL parameter management
- **Timeline**: Week 3-4

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- User journey mapping revealed clear workflow patterns
- Interface layout planning identified optimal tab-based architecture
- Data flow analysis clarified filter hierarchy and cross-tab navigation
- Component architecture mapping provides clear implementation roadmap

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Individual comment editing**: Detailed workflow for tagging, redaction, and publication
- **Data structure design**: Mock data schema for neighbors, comments, and application metadata
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Touch interaction patterns for map and filtering on tablets
- **Performance optimization**: Large dataset handling for applications with 100+ neighbor comments

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Wireframe prototyping**: Create detailed layouts for each tab and major component
- **User story mapping**: Define specific officer personas and their detailed task flows
- **Technical spike sessions**: Explore map library options and performance characteristics

### Questions That Emerged
- How should bulk comment operations work (publish multiple, batch tagging)?
- What's the ideal map zoom level and geographic boundary display?
- Should there be export functionality for officer reports to planning committees?
- How do officers typically prioritize which comments to review first?
