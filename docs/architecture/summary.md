# Summary

This comprehensive fullstack architecture document provides the complete technical foundation for developing the UK Planning Officer Neighbor Response Web App as a **local-only, file-based prototype** using:

✅ **Next.js 14+ with TypeScript** for unified fullstack development  
✅ **Tailwind CSS 4.1+ and Shadcn UI** for professional planning interfaces  
✅ **Leaflet mapping** with spatial-first navigation paradigm  
✅ **Local JSON file storage** for rapid prototyping and data editability  
✅ **Bi-directional map-list synchronization** for planning officer workflows  
✅ **Performance-optimized** for sub-2 second loads and smooth pin interactions  
✅ **Comprehensive testing strategy** with unit, integration, and E2E coverage  

The architecture prioritizes development velocity and workflow validation while maintaining patterns suitable for future migration to production-grade databases and cloud deployment.
